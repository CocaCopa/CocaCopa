### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm John Pandis, a game developer passionate about crafting immersive gaming experiences. I've studied Game Development
at IEK AKMI in Thessaloniki and earned certification as a Pearson Certified game developer. I'm a self-taught developer 
with a focus on Unity, specializing in mechanics, UI, and tool development. While I'm curious about Unreal Engine and C++,
my expertise shines in the world of C# and Unity.

I'm driven to create captivating gaming experiences and push the boundaries of game development. Let's connect and explore 
exciting opportunities to collaborate on GitHub. ðŸŽ®
