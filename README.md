👋 Hi, I’m John - Gameplay Programmer

I design and implement gameplay systems and player-facing features, both from the ground up and within existing production codebases.
My focus is on clear, maintainable code, end-to-end ownership of features, and shipping reliable gameplay under production constraints.

I value collaboration, practical solutions, and code that is easy to read, review, and extend inside a team.
