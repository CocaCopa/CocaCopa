# 👋 Hey, I’m John — Gameplay Programmer  
**Unity (C#)**

I'm a Gameplay Programmer working primarily with Unity (C#), with hands-on experience building and maintaining shipped games in production environments.

I focus on writing clear, maintainable gameplay code, owning systems end-to-end, and integrating features into existing codebases where stability, iteration speed, and player-facing impact matter.

## What I do  

- Implement gameplay systems and features in Unity (C#)
- Work inside existing production codebases
- Own features from implementation to live delivery
- Build modular, event‑driven systems that support fast iteration
- Troubleshoot and fix urgent gameplay issues in live environments

## Tech Stack  

- Unity / C#
- WebGL / WebGPU
- Socket.IO
- JavaScript

## How I work  

- Strong sense of ownership
- Comfortable working under production pressure
- Prefer pragmatic solutions over over‑engineering
- Care about code clarity, but prioritize shipped results
