👋 Hi, I’m John — Gameplay Programmer (Unity / C#)

I work on gameplay systems and player-facing features inside existing production codebases.
My focus is on clear, maintainable code, end-to-end ownership of features, and shipping reliable gameplay under production constraints.

I value collaboration, pragmatic solutions, and code that is easy to read, review, and extend inside a team.
