# 👋 Hey, I’m John — Gameplay Programmer  
**Unity (C#) • Unreal Engine 5 (C++)**

I build gameplay systems, tools, and rapid prototypes in Unity and Unreal Engine. I’ve shipped a **commercial real-money casino title** as the gameplay programmer and contributed features to a **Steam racing game**. On the Unreal side, I develop C++ gameplay prototypes focused on AI, movement, and combat.

### What I work on
- **Gameplay systems** with clean, modular architecture  
- **Responsive controls** and strong gameplay feel  
- **Tools & pipelines** that speed up team development  
- **Production-ready features** delivered under real constraints  

### On this GitHub
You’ll find prototypes, gameplay systems, and experiments across Unity and UE5 (C++), as I continuously refine and expand my craft.
